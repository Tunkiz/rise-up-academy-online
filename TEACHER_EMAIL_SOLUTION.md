# Teacher/Tutor Email Solution

## Problem
Teachers and tutors were not receiving emails after being added by admins because the system required a RESEND_API_KEY to be configured, but it wasn't set up.

## Solution
Implemented a hybrid email approach that leverages both custom emails (when configured) and Supabase's built-in email service as a fallback.

### How It Works

1. **Primary Method - Custom Branded Email (when RESEND_API_KEY is configured)**
   - Sends a professional welcome email with temporary password
   - Includes login details and instructions
   - Better branding and user experience

2. **Fallback Method - Supabase Password Reset Email**
   - Uses Supabase's built-in `generateLink` API for password reset
   - Works without any external API configuration
   - Users receive a password reset link to set up their password

### Implementation Details

#### Edge Function Updates (`create-teacher-tutor`)
- Added fallback logic to use Supabase password reset when custom email fails
- Improved error handling and logging
- Returns detailed response about email sending status

#### Frontend Updates (`AddTeacherTutor.tsx`)
- Updated to handle both email methods
- Improved copy button to work with both temporary passwords and reset links
- Better user feedback about email status

### User Experience

#### When Custom Email Works (RESEND_API_KEY configured)
1. Admin creates teacher/tutor
2. Teacher receives welcome email with:
   - Temporary password
   - Login URL
   - Instructions to change password
3. Teacher logs in with temporary password
4. Teacher changes password on first login

#### When Using Fallback (No RESEND_API_KEY)
1. Admin creates teacher/tutor
2. Teacher receives password reset email from Supabase
3. Teacher clicks link in email to set password
4. Teacher can then log in normally

### Benefits

1. **Always Works**: No longer dependent on external email service configuration
2. **Better UX**: Custom emails provide better branding when available
3. **Flexible**: Graceful fallback ensures teachers always get access
4. **Clear Feedback**: Admin knows exactly what happened with email sending
5. **Manual Backup**: Copy button still available for manual sharing if needed

### Admin Experience

The admin will see clear messages about email status:
- "Teacher created successfully and welcome email sent with login details" (custom email)
- "Teacher created successfully and password reset email sent (please check email to set password)" (fallback)
- "Teacher created successfully but email failed: [error]" (if both methods fail)

### Setup for Custom Emails (Optional)

To enable custom branded emails:
1. Get a free account at https://resend.com
2. Verify your domain (or use their testing domain)
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add it to Supabase secrets:
   ```bash
   npx supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Testing

1. **Test without RESEND_API_KEY** (current state):
   - Create a teacher/tutor
   - Should receive Supabase password reset email
   - Should be able to set password via email link

2. **Test with RESEND_API_KEY** (if configured):
   - Create a teacher/tutor
   - Should receive custom branded email
   - Should be able to log in with temporary password

Both methods ensure teachers/tutors can access their accounts reliably.
